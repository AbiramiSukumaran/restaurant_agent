The sausages are hot dogs. The beans are cold and the portion is only around 100 grams. The bacon is streaky and small but tastes good. The eggs were ok. You have to ask for toast, it does not come as standard. The toast is some kind of artisan bread and it is not toasted only warmed. And don’t expect butter with your warm bread . We were refused butter in a rather aggressive tone by the Turkish owner, who incidentally, I did not see smile once during our 40 mins visit and looked totally bored and uninterested.\nI ordered a pot of tea. After asking for confirmation that I have ordered a POT of tea the Bulgarian waitress quipped that ‘of course it comes in a pot haha’. I replied , ‘I only ask because in Bulgaria it is common to be served tea in a cup or a glass’. She replied ‘oh that’s strange’ I replied yes I agree it is.. I was therefore very confident that a pot of tea would be produced at my table. This was not the case. Despite the conversation with the waitress, it was indeed served in a large glass (see photo) accompanied with a glass of water which was only 20% full. I was given a thin wooden stick for stirring. Although I was given a metal spoon when I requested one. I also had to ask for sugar and milk. When the waitress arrived with my milk she insisted on pouring it herself . I said ok put the whole amount in, to which she replied “ are you sure it seems like a lot” . Make of that what you will, but I thought it was overreaching somewhat.\nAnother couple at the table adjacent to us asked for take away coffee and were told that is not an option.\nNobody wished us well or happy holidays when leaving despite us leaving a sizeable tip.\n\nFood 5/10\nService 1/10\nValue 5//10\n\nThe atmosphere.\nGood decor, fresh flowers on the tables.
